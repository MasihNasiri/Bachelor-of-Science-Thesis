In my undergraduate project, I examined the following faults for a permanent magnet synchronous motor using MATLAB and Simulink. I also trained a model using KNN and SVM networks that can detect faults and identify their location.
List of faults:
  Single-phase fault detection with minimal input variables,
  Detection of the presence or absence of a single-phase fault,
  Detection of the presence or absence of single-phase and two-phase faults,
  Detection of the presence or absence of single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase faults,
  Detection of the presence or absence of a single-phase fault and fault location identification,
  Detection of the presence or absence of single-phase and two-phase faults and fault location identification,
  Detection of the presence or absence of single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase faults and fault location identification.
